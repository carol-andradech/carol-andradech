Founder of **Annabeth Labs** — a tiny cozy studio where I build tools I’d genuinely use. I love creating useful things, especially if they make life softer, easier, or just a little more fun.

## 🧰 What I Do  
I’m a solo dev who genuinely *enjoys* building tools —  
small things with personality, practicality, and care.  
I love cozy software, accessibility, and features that feel human.

## 🧠 How I Work  
I’m a little obsessed with organization…   but my organization often looks like **beautiful chaos**.  
It makes sense to me — and that’s what matters.  
Folders inside folders, notes everywhere.  
It’s part of the fun ✨
